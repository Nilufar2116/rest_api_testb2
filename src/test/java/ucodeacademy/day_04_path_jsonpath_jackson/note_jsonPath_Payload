What is path() method?

In Rest Assured path() & jsonPath() methods are used for extracting data/value from
the response body.

path() method is used to extract data/value from the response body based on given
path expression.

We can use path() method to extract data/value from response body that is in JSON,
XML, and HTML. So path() method is not only limited to JSON body/content-Type.JSON

path() works with any response content type, not just JSON.

jsonPath is class specifically designed for working with JSON response.
jsonPath() is a method specifically designed for working with JSON response.

jsonPath provide more advance and flexibility to work with JSON structure

There are two way of using jsonPath():
1.We create an instance/object of JsonPath and called methods through the object
that comes from JsonPath
EX: JsonPath jsonPath = response.jsonPath():

2. We can directly call jsonPath() and chain the methods that comes from JSONPath()

example: response.jsonPath().methodName()

You can either use path() or jasonPath()
path() -> single, work with any Content type
jsonPath() -> specifically for JSON content type
